<h2 class="chap">LILL&#8217;S TRAVELS IN SANTA CLAUS
LAND.</h2>


<p class="firstword"><span>Effie</span> had been playing with her dolls one cold
December morning, and Lill had been reading,
until both were tired. But it stormed too hard to
go out, and, as Mrs. Pelerine had said they need not
do anything for two hours, their little jaws might
have been dislocated by yawning before they would
as much as pick up a pin. Presently Lill said, &ldquo;Effie,
shall I tell you a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes! do!&rdquo; said Effie, and she climbed up by
Lill in the large rocking-chair in front of the grate.
She kept very still, for she knew Lill&#8217;s stories were
<a name="png.005" id="png.005"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>005</samp>not to be interrupted by a sound, or even a motion.
The first thing Lill did was to fix her eyes on the
fire, and rock backward and forward quite hard for
a little while, and then she said, &ldquo;Now I am going
to tell you about my <i>thought travels</i>, and they are
apt to be a little queerer, but O! ever so much
nicer, than the other kind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Lill&#8217;s stories usually had a formal introduction
she began: &ldquo;Once upon a time, when I was
taking a walk through the great field beyond the
orchard, I went way on, &#8217;round where the path turns
behind the hill. And after I had walked a little way,
I came to a high wall&mdash;built right up into the sky.
At first I thought I had discovered the &lsquo;ends of the
earth,&rsquo; or perhaps I had somehow come to the great
wall of China. But after walking a long way I came
to a large gate, and over it was printed in beautiful
gold letters, &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Santa Claus Land</span>,&rsquo; and the letters
were large enough for a baby to read!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How large that might be Lill did not stop to
explain.</p>

<p class="illusctr">
<a name="I006" id="I006" href="images/img006.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img006-sml.png" width="228" height="367"
 alt="Uncaptioned illustration"
 /></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the gate was shut tight,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and
though I knocked and knocked and knocked, as hard
as I could, nobody came to open it. I was dreadfully
disappointed, because I felt as if Santa Claus must
live here all of the year except when he went out to
<!-- <a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><samp class="pgmark"

[Blank Page]
 --><a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>008</samp>pay Christmas visits, and it would be so lovely to see
him in his own home, you know. But what was I to
do? The gate was entirely too high to climb over,
and there wasn&#8217;t even a crack to peek through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Lill paused, and Effie drew a long breath,
and looked greatly disappointed. Then Lill went
on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see, as I was poking about, I pressed a
bell-spring, and in a moment&mdash;jingle, jingle, jingle,
the bells went ringing far and near, with such a merry
sound as was never heard before. While they were
still ringing the gate slowly opened and I walked in.
I didn&#8217;t even stop to inquire if Santa Claus was at
home, for I forgot all about myself and my manners,
it was so lovely. First there was a small paved square
like a court; it was surrounded by rows and rows of
dark green trees, with several avenues opening between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the centre of the court was a beautiful marble
fountain, with streams of sugar plums and bon-bons
tumbling out of it. Funny-looking little men were
filling cornucopias at the fountain, and pretty little
barefoot children, with chubby hands and dimpled
shoulders, took them as soon as they were filled, and
ran off with them. They were all too much occupied
to speak to me, but as I came up to the fountain one
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>009</samp>of the funny little fellows gave me a cornucopia, and
I marched on with the babies.</p>

<p class="illusctr">
<a name="I010" id="I010" href="images/img010.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img010-sml.png" width="436" height="248"
 alt="Uncaptioned illustration" /></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We went down one of the avenues, which would
have been very dark only it was splendidly lighted
up with Christmas candles. I saw the babies were
slyly eating a candy or two, so I tasted mine, and
they were delicious&mdash;the real Christmas kind. After
we had gone a little way, the trees were smaller and
not so close together, and here there were other
funny little fellows who were climbing up on ladders
and tying toys and bon-bons to the trees. The children
stopped and delivered their packages, but I
walked on, for there was something in the distance
that I was curious to see. I could see that it was a
large garden, that looked as if it might be well cared
for, and had many things growing in it. But even in
the distance it didn&#8217;t look natural, and when I reached
it I found it was a very uncommon kind of a garden
indeed. I could scarcely believe my eyes, but there
were dolls and donkeys and drays and cars and
croquet coming up in long, straight rows, and ever so
many other things beside. In one place the wooden
dolls had only just started; their funny little heads
were just above ground, and I thought they looked
very much surprised at their surroundings. Farther
on were china dolls, that looked quite grown up, and
<!-- <a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>010</samp><a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>011</samp>[Blank Page]
 --><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>012</samp>I suppose were ready to pull; and a gardener was
hoeing a row of soldiers that didn&#8217;t look in a very
healthy condition, or as if they had done very well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gardener looked familiar, I thought, and as I
approached him he stopped work and, leaning on his
hoe he said, &lsquo;How do you do, Lilian? I am very
glad to see you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moment he raised his face I knew it was
Santa Claus, for he looked exactly like the portrait
we have of him. You can easily believe I was glad
then! I ran and put both of my hands in his, fairly
shouting that I was so glad to find him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He laughed and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I am generally to be found here or hereabouts,
for I work in the grounds every day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I laughed too, because his laugh sounded so
funny; like the brook going over stones, and the wind
up in the trees. Two or three times, when I thought
he had done he would burst out again, laughing the
vowels in this way: &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha, ha! He, he, he, he,
he! Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi! Ho, ho, ho, h-o-oo!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lill did it very well, and Effie laughed till the tears
came to her eyes; and she could quite believe Lill
when she said, &ldquo;It grew to be so funny that I couldn&#8217;t
stand, but fell over into one of the little chairs that
were growing in a bed just beyond the soldiers.<a
 name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><samp class="pgmark">013</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;When Santa Claus saw that he stopped suddenly,
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There, that will do. I take a hearty laugh every
day, for the sake of digestion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he added, in a whisper, &lsquo;That is the reason
I live so long and don&#8217;t grow old. I&#8217;ve been the
same age ever since the chroniclers began to take
notes, and those who are best able to judge think I&#8217;ll
continue to be this way for about one thousand eight
hundred and seventy-six years longer,&mdash;they probably
took a new observation at the Centennial, and
they know exactly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was greatly delighted to hear this, and I told
him so. He nodded and winked and said it was &lsquo;all
right,&rsquo; and then asked if I&#8217;d like to see the place. I
said I would, so he threw down the hoe with a sigh,
saying, &lsquo;I don&#8217;t believe I shall have more than half a
crop of soldiers this season. They came up well, but
the arms and legs seem to be weak. When I get to
town I&#8217;ll have to send out some girls with glue pots,
to stick them fast.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The town was at some distance, and our path
took us by flower-beds where some exquisite little
toys were growing, and a hot-bed where new varieties
were being prop&mdash;<i>propagated</i>. Pretty soon we came to
a plantation of young trees, with rattles, and rubber
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>014</samp>balls, and ivory rings growing on the branches, and as
we went past they rang and bounded about in the
merriest sort of a way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&#8217;s a nice growth,&rsquo; said Santa Claus, and it
<i>was</i> a nice growth for babies; but just beyond I saw
something so perfectly splendid that I didn&#8217;t care
about the plantation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lill impressively, seeing that Effie was
sufficiently expectant, &ldquo;It was a lovely grove. The
trees were large, with long <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'dooping'">drooping</ins> branches, and the
branches were just loaded with dolls&#8217; clothes. There
were elegant silk dresses, with lovely sashes of every
color&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just here Effie couldn&#8217;t help saying &ldquo;O!&rdquo; for she
had a weakness for sashes. Lill looked stern, and
put a warning hand over her mouth, and went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was everything that the most fashionable
doll could want, growing in the greatest profusion.
Some of the clothes had fallen, and there were funny-looking
girls picking them up, and packing them in
trunks and boxes. &lsquo;These are all ripe,&rsquo; said Santa
Claus, stopping to shake a tree, and the clothes came
tumbling down so fast that the workers were busier
than ever. The grove was on a hill, so that we had a
beautiful view of the country. First there was a park
filled with reindeer, and beyond that was the town,
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>015</samp>and at one side a large farm-yard filled with animals
of all sorts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as Santa Claus seemed in a hurry I did not
stop long to look. Our path led through the park,
and we stopped to call &lsquo;Prancer&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dancer&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Donder&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blitzen,&rsquo; and Santa Claus fed them with
lumps of sugar from his pocket. He pointed out
&lsquo;Comet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cupid&rsquo; in a distant part of the
park; &lsquo;Dasher&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vixen&rsquo; were nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p class="illusctr">
<a name="I016" id="I016" href="images/img016.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img016-sml.png" width="430" height="400"
 alt="Uncaptioned illustration" /></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I found most of the houses were Swiss
cottages, but there were some fine churches and public
buildings, all of beautifully illustrated building blocks,
and we stopped for a moment at a long depot, in
which a locomotive was just <i>smashing up</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Santa Claus&#8217; house stood in the middle of the
town. It was an old-fashioned looking house, very
broad and low, with an enormous chimney. There
was a wide step in front of the door, shaded by a
fig-tree and grape-vine, and morning-glories and
scarlet beans clambered by the side of the latticed
windows; and there were great round rose-bushes,
with great, round roses, on either side of the walk
leading to the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! it must have smelled like a party,&rdquo; said Effie,
and then subsided, as she remembered that she was
interrupting.<!--
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>016</samp><a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>017</samp>[Blank Page]
 --><a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><samp class="pgmark">018</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside, the house was just cozy and comfortable, a
real grandfatherly sort of a place. A big chair was
drawn up in front of the window, and a big book was
open on a table in front of the chair. A great pack
half made up was on the floor, and Santa Claus
stopped to add a few things from his pocket. Then he
went to the kitchen, and brought me a lunch of milk
and strawberries and cookies, for he said I must be
tired after my long walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After I had rested a little while, he said if I liked
I might go with him to the observatory. But just as
we were starting a funny little fellow stopped at the
door with a wheelbarrow full of boxes of dishes.
After Santa Claus had taken the boxes out and put
them in the pack he said slowly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He laid his finger beside his nose as he said it,
and looked at me attentively, as if I were a sum in
addition, and he was adding me up. I guess I must
have come out right, for he looked satisfied, and said
I&#8217;d better go to the mine first, and then join him in
the observatory. Now I am afraid he was not exactly
polite not to go with me himself,&rdquo; added Lill, gravely,
&ldquo;but then he apologized by saying he had some work
to do. So I followed the little fellow with the wheelbarrow,
and we soon came to what looked like the
entrance of a cave, but I suppose it was the mine. I
<a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>019</samp>followed my guide to the interior without stopping to
look at the boxes and piles of dishes outside. Here
I found other funny little people, busily at work with
picks and shovels, taking out wooden dishes from the
bottom of the cave, and china and glass from the top
and sides, for the dishes hung down just like stalactites
in Mammoth Cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Lill opened the book she had been reading,
and showed Effie a picture of the stalactites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so curious and so pretty that I should have
remained longer,&rdquo; said Lill, &ldquo;only I remembered the
observatory and Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I went outside I heard his voice calling
out, &lsquo;Lilian! Lilian!&rsquo; It sounded a great way off,
and yet somehow it seemed to fill the air just as the
wind does. I only had to look for a moment, for very
near by was a high tower. I wonder I did not see
it before; but in these queer countries you are sure
to see something new every time you look about.
Santa Claus was standing up at a window near the
top, and I ran to the entrance and commenced climbing
the stairs. It was a long journey, and I was
quite out of breath when I came to the end of it. But
here there was such a cozy, luxurious little room, full
of stuffed chairs and lounges, bird cages and flowers
in the windows, and pictures on the wall, that it was
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><samp class="pgmark">
020</samp>delightful to rest. There was a lady sitting by a
golden desk, writing in a large book, and Santa Claus
was looking through a great telescope, and every
once in a while he stopped and put his ear to a
large speaking-tube. While I was resting he went on
with his observations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently he said to the lady, &lsquo;Put down a good
mark for Sarah Buttermilk. I see she is trying to conquer
her quick temper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue; he&#8217;ll
drive his mother to the insane asylum yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bad ones all around for the Crossley children,&mdash;they
quarrel too much.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good one for Harry and Alice Pleasure, they
are quick to mind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And give Ruth Olive ten, for she is a peacemaker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then he happened to look at me and saw I was
rested, so he politely asked what I thought of the
country. I said it was magnificent. He said he was
sorry I didn&#8217;t stop in the green-house, where he had
wax dolls and other delicate things growing. I was
very sorry about that, and then I said I thought he
must be very happy to own so many delightful things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I&#8217;m happy,&rsquo; said Santa Claus, and
then he sighed. &lsquo;But it is an awful responsibility to
<a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>021</samp>reward so many children according to their deserts.
For I take these observations every day, and I know
who is good and who is bad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was glad he told me about this, and now, if he
would only tell me what time of day he took the
observations, I would have obtained really valuable
information. So I stood up and made my best courtesy
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Please, sir, would you tell me what time of day
you usually look?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O,&rsquo; he answered, carelessly, &lsquo;any time from
seven in the morning till ten at night. I am not a
bit particular about time. I often go without my own
meals in order to make a record of table manners.
For instance: last evening I saw you turn your spoon
over in your mouth, and that&#8217;s very unmannerly for a
girl nearly fourteen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, I didn&#8217;t know <i>you</i> were looking,&rsquo; said I, very
much ashamed; &lsquo;and I&#8217;ll never do it again,&rsquo; I
promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he said I might look through the telescope,
and I looked right down into our house. There was
mother very busy and very tired, and all of the
children teasing. It was queer, for I was there, too,
and the <i>bad-est</i> of any. Pretty soon I ran to a quiet
corner with a book, and in a few minutes mamma had

>024</samp>to leave her work and call, &lsquo;Lilian, Lilian, it&#8217;s time
for you to practise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, mamma,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll come right away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as I said this Santa Claus whistled for
&lsquo;Comet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cupid,&rsquo; and they came tearing up the
tower. He put me in a tiny sleigh, and away we
went, over great snow-banks of clouds, and before I
had time to think I was landed in the big chair, and
mamma was calling &lsquo;Lilian, Lilian, it&#8217;s time for you to
practise,&rsquo; just as she is doing now, and I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Lill answered, &ldquo;Yes, mamma,&rdquo; and ran to the
piano.</p>

<p>Effie sank back in the chair to think. She wished
Lill had found out how many black marks she had,
and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Claus&mdash;and
had, in fact, obtained more accurate information about
many things.</p>

<p>But when she asked about some of them <ins class="transcriber"

Lill said she didn&#8217;t know, for the next time

<h2 class="chap">WHAT HAPPENED TO KATHIE
AND LU.</h2>


<p class="firstword"><span>It</span> was a very great misfortune, and it must have
been a sad affliction to the friends of the two children,
for both were once pretty and charming.</p>

<p>It came about in this way.</p>

<p>Little Winnie Tennyson&mdash;she wasn&#8217;t the daughter
of Mr. Alfred Tennyson, the poet-laureate of England,
but <i>was</i> as sweet as any one of that gentleman&#8217;s
poems&mdash;had been to the city; and she had brought
home so many wondrous improvements that her two
little bosom friends, Lu Medway and Kathie Dysart,
were almost struck dumb to behold and to hear what
Winnie said and what Winnie had.<a
 name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><samp class="pgmark">026</samp></p>

<p>For one thing, there were some wooden blocks, all
fluted and grooved, and Winnie could heat these
blocks in the oven, and wet her hair, and lay it
between them, and O! how satin-smooth the waves
would be,&mdash;hair-pin-crimps and braid-crimps were
nothing to this new and scientific way.</p>

<p>Winnie also made it a matter of pride to display
her overskirts. These were arranged with ever so
many tapes on the inside, and would readily tie up
into the most ravishing bunches and puffs&mdash;how Lu
and Kathie, wee-est mites of women though they
were, did envy Winnie her tapes! Their mammas
didn&#8217;t know how to loop a dress&mdash;witness their little
skirts pinned back into what Kathie called a &ldquo;wopse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also had brought some tiny parlor skates, and,
withal, many airs and graces which her two young-lady
aunties had taught her, among others a funny
little new accent on some of her words,&mdash;the word
&ldquo;pretty&rdquo; in particular. And, last of all, she had
been taught to dance!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can show <i>you</i>,&rdquo; Winnie said, eagerly,
&ldquo;&#8217;cause it goes by &lsquo;steps,&rsquo; and uncle says I take them
as pr-i-tty as Cousin Lily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, in Connaut, little girls don&#8217;t dance&mdash;not <i>nice</i>
little girls, nor nice big girls either, for that matter.</p>

<p>The dimpled mouths opened in astonishment.
&ldquo;That is wicked, Winnie Ten&#8217;son, don&#8217;t you know?&rdquo;<a
 name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><samp class="pgmark">027</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, but &#8217;tisn&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Winnie. &ldquo;My aunties dance,
and their mamma, my grandmamma, was at the party
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall tell our mothers,&rdquo; said Lu. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll bet
you&#8217;ve come home a proud, wicked girl, and you want
us to be as bad as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illusctr"><a name="I027" id="I027" href="images/img027.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img027-sml.png" width="339" height="311"
 alt="Winnie already had her class before her." /></a><br />
&ldquo;Winnie already had her class before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Winnie was only six years old, about the same
age as her virtuous friends, and she didn&#8217;t look very
wicked. She had pink cheeks, and blue eyes, and
dimples. She stood gazing at her accusers, first at
one and then at the other.<a
 name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><samp class="pgmark">028</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;Luie,&rdquo; said Kathie, gravely, &ldquo;we mustn&#8217;t call
Winnie wicked till we ask our mothers if she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&#8217;t think I would,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tennyson,
looking up from her sewing, her cheek flushing at the
sight of tears in her little Winnie&#8217;s gentle eyes.</p>

<p>On the way home, they chanced to see their own
minister walking along. Lu stopped short. &ldquo;Kathie,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;I know it&#8217;s awful wicked now, or else we
never should have met the minister right here. I&#8217;m
just going to tell him about Winnie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went up to him, Kathie following shyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodhue, Winnie Ten&#8217;son is a nawful wicked
girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <i>is!</i>&rdquo; said Mr. Goodhue, stopping, and looking
down into the little eager face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she is. She wants us to dance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <i>does!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she does. She wanted us to learn the
steps, right down in her garden this afternoon. Would
you dance, Mr. Goodhue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would I? Perhaps I might, were I as little and
spry as you, and Winnie would teach me steps, and it
was down in the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girls looked up into his face searchingly.
He walked on laughing, and they went on homeward,
to ask further advice.<a
 name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><samp class="pgmark">029</samp></p>

<p>At home, too, everyone seemed to think it a matter
for smiles, and laughed at the two tender little consciences.</p>

<p>So they both ran back after dinner to Mrs. Tennyson&#8217;s.
But on the way Kathie said, &ldquo;They let us, the
minister and ev&#8217;ry body, but if it is wicked <i>ever</i>, how
isn&#8217;t it wicked <i>now</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&#8217;pose &#8217;cause we&#8217;re children,&rdquo; Lu said wisely.</p>

<p>The logical trouble thus laid, they tripped on.</p>

<p>They were dressed in sweet pink, and their sun-bonnets
were as fresh and crisp as only the sun-bonnets
of dear little country school-girls ever can be. It was
a most merry summer day; all nature moving gladsomely
to the full music of life. The leaves were
fluttering to each other, the grasses sweeping up and
down, the bobolinks hopping by the meadow path.</p>

<p>Their friend Winnie came out to meet them, looking
rather astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re going to learn,&rdquo; shouted Lu, &ldquo;get on your
bonnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you wasn&#8217;t good to me to-day,&rdquo; said Winnie,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&#8217;t da&#8217;st to be,&rdquo; said Kathie, &ldquo;till we&#8217;d
asked somebody that knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Tennyson was half of the mind to call her
little daughter in; yet she felt it a pity to be less
sweet and forgiving than the child.<a
 name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><samp class="pgmark">030</samp></p>

<p>Winnie already had her class before her. &ldquo;Now
you must do just as I do. You must hold your dress
back so,&mdash;not grab it, but hold it back nice, and you
must bend forward so, and you must point your slippers
so,&mdash;not stand flat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very graceful the little dancing-teacher looked, tip-toeing
here, gliding there, twinkling through a series
of pretty steps down the long garden walk.</p>

<p>But the pupils! Do the best she might, sturdy
little Kathie couldn&#8217;t manage her dress. She grasped
it tightly in either fat little fist. &ldquo;Mother Bunch!&rdquo;
Lu giggled behind her back.</p>

<p>Kathie&#8217;s face got very red over that. It was well
enough to be &ldquo;Dumpling,&rdquo;&mdash;everybody loves a dumpling;
but &ldquo;Mother Bunch!&rdquo; So she bounced and
shuffled a little longer, and then she said she was
going home.</p>

<p>But Miss Lu wasn&#8217;t ready. She greatly liked the
new fun, the hopping and whirling to Winnie&#8217;s steady
&ldquo;One, two, <i>three!</i> One, two, <i>three!</i>&rdquo; There was a
grown-up, affected smirk on her delicate little face, at
which Mrs. Tennyson laughed every time she looked
out. I think Lu would have hopped and minced up
and down the walk until night, if Winnie&#8217;s mother
hadn&#8217;t told them it was time to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t like her old steps,&rdquo; said Kathie. They
were sitting on a daisy bank near Mr. Medway&#8217;s.<a
 name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><samp class="pgmark">031</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Lu. &ldquo;And you would, too, if you
wasn&#8217;t so chunked. You just bounced up and down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kathie burst out crying. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll bet dancing steps <i>is</i>
wicked, for you never was so mean before in your life,
so! And you didn&#8217;t dance near so pretty as Winnie,
and you needn&#8217;t think you ever will, for you <i>never</i>
will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I won&#8217;t, won&#8217;t I?&rdquo; said Lu, teasingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you won&#8217;t. I won&#8217;t be wicked and say you
are nice, for you&#8217;re horrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>&#8217;re wicked this minute, Kathie Dysart, for
<i>you</i>&#8217;re mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as she laughed a naughty laugh, and as Kathie
glared back at her, then it was that that which happened
began to happen. Lu&#8217;s delicate, rosy mouth
commenced drawing up at the corners in an ugly
fashion, and her nose commenced drawing down, while
her dimpled chin thrust itself out in a taunting manner;
but the horror of it was that she couldn&#8217;t
straighten her lips, nor could she draw in her chin
when she tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>dis&#8217;gree&#8217;ble</i> thing!&rdquo; shrieked Kathie, looking
at her and feeling dreadfully, her eyebrows knotting
up like two little squirming snakes. &ldquo;If I&#8217;m a
Mother Bunch, you&#8217;re a bean-pole, and you&#8217;ll be an
ugly old witch some day, and you&#8217;ll dry up and you&#8217;ll
blow away.&rdquo;<a
 name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><samp class="pgmark">032</samp></p>

<p>By this time the two little pink starched sun-bonnets
fairly stood on end at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kathie Dysart, I&#8217;ll tell your Sunday-school teacher,
see if I don&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her what? you old, <i>old</i>, <span class="allsc">OLD</span> thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illusctr">
<a name="I032" id="I032" href="images/img032.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img032-sml.png" width="397" height="314"
 alt="They grew older and uglier each moment." /></a><br />
&ldquo;They grew older and uglier each moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kathie Dysart loved her Sunday-school teacher,
and now she <i>was</i> in a rage. She couldn&#8217;t begin to
scowl as fiercely as she felt; her cheeks sunk in, her
lips drew down, her nose grew sharp and long in the
effort. And, all at once, as the children say, her face
&ldquo;froze&rdquo; so. Oh! it was perfectly horrid, that which
happened to the two little dears, it was indeed. They
could not possibly look away from each other, and
they grew older and uglier each moment! Why, their
<a name="png.033" id="png.033"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>033</samp>very sun-bonnets&mdash;those fresh little pink sun-bonnets&mdash;shriveled
into old women&#8217;s caps, and even in the
hearts of the poor little old crones the hardening
process was going on, a fierce fire of hate scorching the
last central drop of dew, until nothing would ever,
ever grow and bloom again.</p>

<p>It was all over with Lu and Kathie forever and
ever.</p>

<p class="tb">
All this was long ago, of course&mdash;indeed, it happened
&ldquo;once upon a time.&rdquo; It would be difficult now
to verify each point in the account. On the contrary,
I suppose it just possible that there may be a mistake
as to the transformation of the children&#8217;s clothes&mdash;the
change of the sun-bonnets into caps, for instance.</p>

<p>But, as a whole, I see no reason to doubt the story.
Often, and quite recently, too, I have seen little faces
in danger of a similar transformation.</p>

<p>Where anger, envy, spite, and some others of the
ill-tempers, gain control of the nerves and muscles of
the human countenance, they pull and twitch and
knot and tie these nerves and muscles, until it is almost
impossible to recognize the face.</p>

<p>Sometimes this change has passed off in a minute;
but at other times it has lasted for hours, and there
is <i>always</i> danger that the face will fail to recover its
<a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>034</samp>pleasantness wholly, that traces will remain, like
wrinkles in a ribbon that has been tied, and that, at
last, the transformation will be final and fatal, and the
fair child become and remain &ldquo;a horrid old witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of one thing we all are certain&mdash;that the most
gossiping and malicious person now living was once a
fair and innocent child; so who shall say that this
which I have related did <i>not</i> happen to Lu and
Kathie?</p>

<h2 class="chap">FLAXIE FRIZZLE.</h2>


<p class="firstword"><span>Her</span> name was Mary Gray, but they called her
Flaxie Frizzle. She had light curly hair, and
a curly nose. That is, her nose curled up at the end
a wee bit, just enough to make it look cunning.</p>

<p>What kind of a child was she?</p>

<p>Well, I don&#8217;t want to tell; but I suppose I shall
have to. She wasn&#8217;t gentle and timid and sweet like
you little darlings, oh, no! not like you. And Mrs.
Willard, who was there visiting from Boston, said she
was &ldquo;dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was always talking at the table, for one thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said she, one day, from her high chair,
&ldquo;your littlest one doesn&#8217;t like fish; what makes you
cook him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mamma shook her head, but Flaxie wouldn&#8217;t look
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>036</samp>at it. Mrs. Willard was saying, &ldquo;When we go to
ride this afternoon we can stop at the slate-quarry.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Who</i> was going to ride? And would they take the
&ldquo;littlest one&rdquo; too? Flaxie meant to find out.</p>

<p class="illusctr"><a name="I036" id="I036" href="images/img036.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img036-sml.png" width="299" height="345"
 alt="Flaxie Frizzle." /></a><br />
Flaxie Frizzle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you love me, mamma?&rdquo; said she, beating her
mug against her red waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you are a good girl, Flaxie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look right in my eyes, mamma. Don&#8217;t you
see I <i>are</i> a good girl? And <i>mayn&#8217;t</i> I go a-riding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat your dinner, Mary Gray, and don&#8217;t talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother never called her Mary Gray except
when she was troublesome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you sumpin, mamma,&rdquo; whispered
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>037</samp>she, bending forward and almost scalding herself
against the teapot, &ldquo;I <i>won&#8217;t</i> talk; I won&#8217;t talk <i>a</i> tall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was of no use. Mrs. Willard was not fond
of little girls, and Mrs. Gray would not take Flaxie;
she must stay at home with her sister Ninny.</p>

<p>Now Ninny&mdash;or Julia&mdash;was almost ten years old,
a dear, good, patient little girl, who bore with Flaxie&#8217;s
naughtiness, and hardly ever complained. But this
afternoon, at four o&#8217;clock, her best friend, Eva Snow,
was coming, and Ninny did hope that by that time
her mamma would be at home again!</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Willard rode off in the carriage;
and the moment they were gone, Flaxie began
to frisk like a wild creature.</p>

<p>First she ran out to the gate, and screamed to a
man going by,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How d&#8217;ye do, Mr. Man? You <i>mustn&#8217;t</i> smoke!
My mamma don&#8217;t like it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why <i>did</i> you do that?&rdquo; said Ninny, her face
covered with blushes, as she darted after Flaxie, and
brought her into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, show me your new picture-book, and
I won&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As long as she was looking at pictures she was out
of mischief, and Ninny turned the leaves very patiently.</p>

<p>But soon the cat came into the room with the new
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>038</samp>kitten in her mouth, and then Flaxie screamed with
terror. She thought the cat was eating it up for a
mouse; but instead of that she dropped it gently on
the sofa, purring, and looking at the two little girls as
if to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it a nice baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flaxie thought it was; you could see that by the
way she kissed it. But when she picked it up and
marched about with it, the old cat mewed fearfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put it down,&rdquo; said Ninny. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you see how
bad you make its mother feel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I&#8217;s goin&#8217; to carry it over the bridge, and
show it to my grandma; she wants to see this kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ninny looked troubled. She hardly dared say
Flaxie must not go, for fear that would make her
want to go all the more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a funny spot kitty has on its face,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;white all over; with a yellow star on its forehead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Flaxie, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll wash it off.&rdquo; And away
she flew to the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you up to now?&rdquo; said Dora, the housemaid,
who stood there with her bonnet on. &ldquo;You&#8217;ll
drown that poor little creetur, and squeeze it to death
too! Miss Ninny, why don&#8217;t you attend to your little
sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear Ninny! as if she were not doing her best!
<a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>039</samp>And here it was half-past three, and Eva Snow coming
at four!</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Dodo!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you&#8217;re not going off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only just round the corner, Miss Ninny. I&#8217;ll be
right back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was a pity she should go out at all. Mrs.
Gray did not suppose she would leave the house while
she was gone.</p>

<p>As soon as &ldquo;Dodo&rdquo; was out of sight, Flaxie thought
she could have her own way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Ninny! you&#8217;re my darlin&#8217; sister,&rdquo; said she, with
a very sweet smile. &ldquo;Will you lem me carry my kitty
over to grandma&#8217;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no indeed! You mustn&#8217;t go &#8217;way over the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I mus&#8217;. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t hurt me <i>a</i> tall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&#8217;t let you, Flaxie Frizzle; truly I can&#8217;t;
so don&#8217;t ask me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flaxie&#8217;s lip curled as well as her nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poh! I haven&#8217;t got so good a sister as I fought I
had. Laugh to me, Ninny, and get me my pretty new
hat, or I&#8217;ll shut you up in the closet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ninny did laugh, it was so funny to hear that speck
of a child talk of punishing a big girl like her!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you lem me go?&rdquo; repeated Flaxie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! What an idea!&rdquo;<a
 name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><samp class="pgmark">040</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve got fi-ive cents, Ninny. I&#8217;ll buy you anyfing
what you want? Now lem me! &#8217;Twon&#8217;t hurt me <i>a</i>
tall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ninny shook her head, and kept shaking it; and
Flaxie began to push her toward the closet door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you get my hat, Ninny? &#8217;Cause when I die
&#8217;n&#8217; go to hebben, then you won&#8217;t have no little sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not get your hat, miss, so there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this while Flaxie was pushing, and Ninny was
shaking her head. The closet-door stood open, and,
before Ninny thought much about it, she was inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you is!&rdquo; laughed the baby.</p>

<p>Then rising on her &ldquo;tippy-toes,&rdquo; Flaxie began to
fumble with the key. Ninny smiled to hear her
breathe so hard, but never thought the wee, wee fingers
could do any harm.</p>

<p>At last the key, after clicking for a good while,
turned round in the lock; yes, fairly turned. The
door was fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me out! out! out!&rdquo; cried Ninny, pounding
with both hands.</p>

<p>Flaxie was perfectly delighted. She had not known
till then that the door was locked, and if Ninny had
been quiet she would probably have kept fumbling
away till she opened it. But now she wouldn&#8217;t so
much as touch the key, you may be sure. O,
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>041</samp>Flaxie Frizzle was a big rogue, as big as she <i>could</i> be,
and be so little! There she stood, hopping up and
down, and laughing, with the blind kitty hugged close
to her bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laugh to me, Ninny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I want to laugh for? Let me out, you
naughty girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> needn&#8217;t laugh, but <i>I</i> shall. Now I&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to grandma&#8217;s, and carry my white kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, you mustn&#8217;t, you mustn&#8217;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> can&#8217;t help it! I <i>is</i> a goin&#8217;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flaxie! Flax-ee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh! where was Eva Snow? Would she never
come? There was a sliding-door in the wall above
the middle shelf, and Ninny climbed up and pushed
it back. It opened into the parlor-closet, where the
china dishes stood. If she could only crawl through
that sliding door she might get out by way of the
parlor, if she <i>did</i> break the dishes.</p>

<p>But, oh dear! it wasn&#8217;t half big enough. She could
only put her head in, and part of one shoulder. What
should she do?</p>

<p>It was of no use screaming to that witch of a
Frizzle; but she did scream. She threatened to
&ldquo;whip her,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tie her,&rdquo; and &ldquo;box her ears,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;burn up her dollies.&rdquo;<a
 name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><samp class="pgmark">042</samp></p>

<p>But Flaxie knew she wouldn&#8217;t; so she calmly
pulled off her boots and put on her rubbers.</p>

<p>Then Ninny coaxed. She promised candy and
oranges and even wedding-cake, for she forgot she
hadn&#8217;t a speck of wedding-cake in the world.</p>

<p>But, while she was still screaming, Flaxie was
out of sight and hearing. She hadn&#8217;t found her hat;
but, with her new rubbers on her feet, and the blind
kitty still hugged to her bosom, she was &ldquo;going to
grandma&#8217;s.&rdquo; She ran with all her might; for what
if somebody should catch her before she got there!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The faster I hurry the quicker I can&#8217;t go,&rdquo; said
she, puffing for breath.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day. The wind blew over the
grass, and the grass moved in green waves; Flaxie
thought it was running away like herself.</p>

<p>It was half a mile to the bridge. By the time she
reached Mr. Pratt&#8217;s store, which was half way, she
thought she would stop to rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Cause he&#8217;ll give me some candy,&rdquo; said she, and
walked right into the store, though it was half full of
men,&mdash;oh fie! Flaxie Frizzle!</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, a lame man, was sitting next the door,
and she walked boldly up to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. <i>Lame</i> Jones, does you want to see my kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, and took it in his hands; and another
man pinched its tail. Flaxie screamed out:<a
 name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><samp class="pgmark">043</samp></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&#8217;t hold it by the handle, Mr. Man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they all laughed more than ever, and clapped
their hands; and Mr. Jones said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re a cunning baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Flaxie, quickly, &ldquo;what makes you
have turn-about feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t a proper thing to say, and it made Mr.
Jones look sober, for he was sorry to have such feet.
Mr. Pratt was afraid Flaxie would talk more about
them; so he frowned at her and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good little girls don&#8217;t run away bare-headed, Miss
Frizzle! Is your mamma at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&#8217;ll go now,&rdquo; said Flaxie; &ldquo;some more
folks will want to see my kitty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pratt&#8217;s boy ran after her with a stick of candy,
but could not catch her. She called now at all the
houses along the road, ringing the bells so furiously
that people rushed to the doors, afraid something
dreadful had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fought you&#8217;d want to see my kitty,&rdquo; said the
runaway, holding up the little blind bundle; and they
always laughed then; how could they help it?</p>

<p>But somehow nobody thought of sending her home.</p>

<p>When she reached the bridge she was hungry, and
told the &ldquo;bridge-man&rdquo; she was &ldquo;fond of cookies.&rdquo;
His wife gave her a caraway-cake shaped like a
leaf.

>046</samp>&ldquo;I&#8217;m fond o&#8217; that one,&rdquo; said she, with her mouth
full. &ldquo;Please give me <i>two</i> ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just fancy it! Begging food at people&#8217;s houses!
Yet her mamma <i>had</i> tried to teach her good manners,
little as you may think it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe she has had any supper. It must
be she is running away,&rdquo; said the bridge-man&#8217;s wife,
as Flaxie left her door. &ldquo;I ought to have stopped
her; but somebody will, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But nobody did. People only laughed at her kitty,
and then passed on.</p>

<p>Soon the sun set, and the new moon shone white
against the blue sky. Flaxie had often seen the
moon, but it looked larger and rounder than this.
What ailed it now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;God has doubled it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had changed her mind, and did not want to go
to her grandmother&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pratt fought I was bare-headed, and grandma&#8217;ll
fink I&#8217;m bare-headed. Guess I won&#8217;t go to g&#8217;andma&#8217;s,
kitty, I&#8217;ll go to preach-man&#8217;s house; preach-man will
want to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On she went till she came to the church. Then she
sat down on the big steps, dreadfully tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my yubbers ache so! Now go s&#8217;eep, Kitty;
and when you want to wake up, call me, and I&#8217;ll wake
you.&rdquo;<a
 name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><samp class="pgmark">047</samp></p>

<p>This was the last Flaxie remembered. When the
postmaster found her, she was sitting up, fast asleep,
with her little tow head against the door, and the
kitty in her arms. The kitty was still alive.</p>

<p>Eva Snow had come and let Ninny out of the closet
long ago; and lots of people had been hunting ever
since for Flaxie Frizzle. When the postmaster and
the minister brought her home between them, Mrs.
Gray was so very glad that she laughed and cried.
Still she thought Flaxie ought to be punished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O mamma,&rdquo; said Miss Frizzle next morning, very
much surprised to find herself tied by the clothes-line
to a knob in the bay-window. &ldquo;The men laughed to
me, they did! Mr. Lame Jones, he <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: 'd' partly missing from scan">said</ins> I was very
cunning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But for all that, her mamma did not <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: 'u' not clear, 'n' missing from scan">untie</ins> her till
afternoon; and then Flaxie promised &ldquo;<ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: 'n' missing from scan">honestly</ins>,&rdquo; not
to run away again.</p>

<p>Would you trust her?</p>

/><img class="initial" src="images/deco048cc.png" alt=""

/><span class="firstword">hey</span> don&#8217;t name girls &ldquo;Roxy,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Patty,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sally,&rdquo;
nowadays; but when the little miss
who is my heroine was a lady, those
short, funny old names were not at all old-fashioned.
&ldquo;Roxy,&rdquo; especially, was considered
a very sweet name indeed. All these new
names, &ldquo;Eva,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ada,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sadie,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lillie,&rdquo; and the rest of the fanciful &ldquo;ies&rdquo; were not
in vogue. Then, if a romantic, highflown young mamma
wished to give her tiny girl-baby an unusually fine
name, she selected such as &ldquo;Sophronia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Matilda,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lucretia,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ophelia.&rdquo; In extreme cases, the
baby could be called &ldquo;Victoria Adelaide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this instance baby&#8217;s mother was a plain, quiet
<a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>049</samp>woman; and she thought baby&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s name
was quite fine enough for baby; and so baby was
called &ldquo;Roxy,&rdquo; and, when she was ten years old, you
would have thought little Roxy fully as old-fashioned
as her name.</p>

<p><i>I think it is her clothes</i> that makes her image look
so funny as she rises up before me. She herself had
brown hair and eyes, and a good country complexion
of milk and roses&mdash;such a nice complexion, girls!
You see she had plenty of bread and milk to eat; and
a big chamber, big as the sitting-room down stairs,
to sleep in&mdash;all windows&mdash;and her bed stood, neat
and cool, in the middle of the floor; and she had to
walk ever so far to get anywhere&mdash;it was a respectable
little run even out to the barn for the hens&#8217; eggs;
and it was half a mile to her cousin Hannah&#8217;s, and it
was three quarters to school, and just a mile to the
very nearest stick of candy or cluster of raisins. Nuts
were a little nearer; for Roxy&#8217;s father had a noble
butternut orchard, and it was as much a part of the
regular farm-work in the fall to gather the &ldquo;but&#8217;nuts&rdquo;
as it was to gather the apples.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you see, now, why she had such a nice complexion?
But if you think it don&#8217;t quite account for
such plump, rosy cheeks, why, then, she had to chase
ever so many ways for the strawberries. Not a strawberry
<a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>050</samp>was raised in common folks&#8217; gardens in those
days. They grew mostly in farmers&#8217; meadows; and
very angry those farmers used to be at such girls
as Roxy in &ldquo;strawberry time&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;strawberry time&rdquo;
comes before &ldquo;mowing,&rdquo; you know&mdash;for how they did
wallow and trample the grass! Besides, the raspberries
and blackberries, instead of being Doolittle
Blackcaps, and Kittatinnies, and tied up to nice stakes
in civilized little plantations, grew away off upon steep
hill-sides, and in the edges of woods, by old logs, and
around stumps; and it took at least three girls, and
half a day, and a lunch-basket, and torn dresses, and
such clambering, and such fun, to get them! <i>Of course</i>
Roxy had red cheeks, and a sweet breath, and plump,
firm white flesh&mdash;<i>so</i> white wherever it wasn&#8217;t browned
by the sunshine.</p>

<p>But otherwise she certainly was old-fashioned, almost
quaint. Her hair was braided tight in two long
braids, crossed on her neck, and tied with a bit of
black thread; there was a pair of precious little blue
ribbons in the drawer for Sundays and high days.
Roxy&#8217;s mother would have been awfully shocked at
the wavy, flowing hair of you Wide Awake girls, I
assure you!</p>

<p>And Roxy&#8217;s dress. <i>You</i> never saw a &ldquo;tow and
linen&rdquo; dress, I dare say. Roxy&#8217;s dresses were all
<a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>051</samp>&ldquo;home-made&rdquo;&mdash;not merely cut and sewed at home;
but Roxy&#8217;s father raised the flax in the field north of
the house, and Roxy&#8217;s mother spun the flax and tow
into thread upon funny little wheels. Then she
colored the thread, part of it indigo blue, and part
of &ldquo;copperas color,&rdquo; and after that wove it into
cloth&mdash;not just enough for a dress, but enough for
two dresses for Roxy, two for herself, and some
for the men folks&#8217; shirts, besides yards and yards of
dreadfully coarse cloth for &ldquo;trousers;&rdquo; and perhaps
there was a fine white piece for sheets and pillowcases.
Bless me! how the farmers&#8217; wives did work
eighty years ago!</p>

<p>And how that &ldquo;blue and copperas check&rdquo; did wear,
and how it did shine when it was freshly washed and
ironed! Only it was made up so ungracefully&mdash;just
a plain, full skirt, plain, straight waist, and plain
straight sleeves. <i>You</i> never saw a dress made so,
because children&#8217;s clothes have been cut pretty and
cunning for a great many years. Roxy&#8217;s dresses were
short, and she wore straight, full &ldquo;pantalets,&rdquo; that
came down to the tops of her shoes; for Mrs. Thomas
Gildersleeve would have thought it dreadful to allow
her daughter to show the shape of her round little
legs, as all children do nowadays.</p>

<p>To finish up, Roxy wore a &ldquo;tie-apron.&rdquo; This was
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>052</samp>simply a straight breadth of &ldquo;store calico,&rdquo; gathered
upon a band with long ends, and tied round her waist.
Very important a little girl felt when allowed to leave
off the high apron and don the &ldquo;tie-apron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first day she came to school with it on, her
mates would stand one side and look at her. &ldquo;O,
dear! you feel big&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&rdquo; they would say to
her. Maybe she would be obliged to &ldquo;associate by
herself&rdquo; for a day or so, until they became accustomed
to the sight of the &ldquo;tie-apron,&rdquo; or until her
own good nature got the better of their envy.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;slat sun-bonnet,&rdquo; made of calico and pasteboard,
completed Roxy&#8217;s costume on the summer morning of
an eventful day in her life. It was drawn just as far
on as could be. It hid her face completely. She was
pacing along slowly, head bent down, to school. It
was only eight o&#8217;clock. Why was Roxy so early?</p>

<p>Well, this morning she preferred to be away from
her mother. She was &ldquo;mad&rdquo; at both her father and
mother. &ldquo;Stingy things!&rdquo; she said, with a great,
angry sob.</p>

<p>About that time of every year, June, the children
were forbidden to go indiscriminately any more to the
&ldquo;maple sugar tub.&rdquo; The sweet store would begin
to lessen alarmingly by that time, and the indulgent
mother would begin to economize.<a
 name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><samp class="pgmark">053</samp></p>

<p>Every day since they &ldquo;made sugar,&rdquo; Roxy had had
the felicity of carrying a great, brown, irregular, tempting
chunk of maple sugar to school. She had always
divided with the girls generously. Her father did
not often give her pennies to buy cinnamon, candy,
raisins, and cloves with; so she used to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; with
maple sugar in the summer, and with &ldquo;but&#8217;nut meats&rdquo;
in the winter, in return for the &ldquo;store goodies&rdquo; other
girls had.</p>

<p>For a week now she had been prohibited the sugar-tub.
This morning she had asked her father for
sixpence, to buy cinnamon. She had been refused.
&ldquo;Stingy things!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;They think a little
girl can live without money just as well as not. O,
I am so ashamed! I&#8217;d like to see how mother would
like to be invited to tea by the neighbors, and never
ask any of them to <i>her</i> house. I guess she&#8217;d feel
mean! But they think because I am a little girl,
there&#8217;s no need of <i>my</i> being polite and free-hearted!
Polly Stedman has given me cinnamon three times,
and I <i>know</i> the girls think I&#8217;m stingy! I&#8217;m <i>so</i>
ashamed!&rdquo; And Roxy&#8217;s red cheeks and shining
brown eyes brimmed up and overflowed with tears.</p>

<p>Poor little Roxy! she herself had such a big sweet
tooth! It was absolutely impossible for her to refuse
a piece of stick cinnamon or a peppermint drop.
<a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>054</samp>Yesterday she had told the girls she should certainly
bring maple sugar to-day. She meant to, too, even
if she &ldquo;took&rdquo; it. But there her mother had stood
at the broad shelf all the morning, making pies and
ginger snaps, and the sugar-tub set under the broad
shelf. There was no chance. She finally had asked
her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Roxy; the sugar will be gone in less than
a month. You children eat more sugar every year
than I use in cooking. It&#8217;s a wonder you have any
stomachs left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised the girls some,&rdquo; pleaded Roxy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promised the girls! You&#8217;ve fed these girls ever
since the sugar was made. Off with you! What do
you suppose your father&#8217;d say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roxy wouldn&#8217;t have dared tell her father. He was
a stirring, hard-working man, that gave his family all
the luxuries and comforts that could be &ldquo;raised&rdquo; on
the farm; but bought few, and growled over what he
did buy, and made no &ldquo;store debts.&rdquo; It was high
time, in fact, that Roxy&#8217;s indulgent mother should
begin to husband the sugar.</p>

<p>Roxy saw there would be no chance to &ldquo;take&rdquo;
the sugar; so she had mournfully started off. Is it
strange that so generous a girl would have stolen, if
she could? Why, children, I have seen many a man
<a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>055</samp>do mean, wrong, dishonest deeds, in order to be
thought generous, and a &ldquo;royal good fellow,&rdquo; by his
own particular friends; and Roxy would a thousand
times rather have &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; than to have faced her
mates empty-handed this morning. She walked on
in sorrowful meditation. She thought once of going
back, to see if there were eggs at the barn&mdash;she
might take them down to the store, and get candy.
But she remembered they were all brought in last
night, and it was too early for the hens to have laid
this morning.</p>

<p>As she pondered ways and means in her little brain,
a daring thought struck her. That thought took away
her breath. She turned white and cold. Then she
turned burning red all over. Her little feet shook
under her. But, my! What riches! What a supply
to go to! How they would envy her!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care&mdash;so. They needn&#8217;t be so stingy
with me! And Mrs. Reub uses so much such things
I don&#8217;t believe it will ever be noticed in the &lsquo;account&rsquo;&mdash;and,
any way, it&#8217;ll be six months before he settles
up. Nobody will know it till then, and maybe&mdash;<i>maybe</i>
I shall be dead by that time, or the world will burn
up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these comforting reflections, Roxy straightened
up her little sun-bonneted head, doubled her
<a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>056</samp>little brown fists, and ran as hard as she could&mdash;and
Roxy could outrun most of the boys. On she ran,
past the school-house&mdash;it was not yet unlocked&mdash;right
on down to the village. She slacked up as she
struck the sidewalks. She walked slower and slower,
to cool her bounding pulses and burning skin.</p>

<p>Still her cheeks were like two blood-red roses as
she walked into the cool, dark, old stone store; but
for some reason, mental, moral, or physical, while her
cheeks remained red, her little legs and arms grew
stone cold and stiff, and spots like blood came before
her eyes, and a great ringing filled her ears, as Mr.
Hampshire, the merchant himself, instead of his clerk,
came to wait upon her. &ldquo;And what will you have,
Miss Roxy&mdash;some peppermints?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. If you please, Mrs. Reuben Markham
wants two pounds of raisins, and five pounds of cinnamon,
and you are to charge it to Mr. Markham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was strange, but her voice never faltered after
she got well begun. However, for all that, Mr. Hampshire
stared at her. &ldquo;<i>Five pounds of cinnamon</i>, did
you say, sis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, if you please,&rdquo; answered Roxy, quietly,
&ldquo;and two pounds of raisins.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="illusctr"><a name="I058" id="I058" href="images/img058.png" target="_blank"
><img src="images/img058-sml.png" width="426" height="274"
 alt="Uncaptioned illustration" /></a>
</p>

<p>So Mr. Hampshire went back, and weighed out the
cinnamon and raisins, and gave them to her. She
<a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>057</samp>was a little startled at the mighty bundle five pounds
of stick cinnamon made; but she took them and went
out, and Mr. Hampshire went back and charged the
things to Mr. Reuben Markham.</p>

<p>Miss Roxy went speeding back to the school-house
with her aromatic bundle. Her face was fairly radiant.
She had no idea five pounds of cinnamon were
so much. O, <i>such a lot</i>! She had made up her mind
what to do with it. She couldn&#8217;t, of course, carry it
home. She had no trunk that would lock, or any
place safe from her mother&#8217;s eyes. But in the grove,
back of the school-house, there was a tree with a hollow
in it. By hard running she got there before any
of the scholars came. She put her fragrant packages
in, first filling her pocket, and then stopped the remaining
space with a couple of innocent-looking stones.</p>

<p>Such a happy day as it was! She found herself a
perfect princess among her mates. She &ldquo;treated&rdquo;
them royally, I assure you. Everybody was so obliging
to her all day, and it was so nice to be able to
make everybody pleased and grateful! Both the day
of judgment and the dying day were put afar off&mdash;at
least six months off.</p>

<p>Meantime, during the forenoon, Mr. Hampshire
kept referring to the idea that any one could want <i>five
pounds of cinnamon</i> at one time. Still, little Roxy
<!-- <a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>058</samp> --><a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>059</samp>was Mrs. Reub Markham&#8217;s next neighbor, and it was
perfectly probable that she should send by her.</p>

<p>Some time in the afternoon Mr. Reuben Markham
came down to the store. He was a wealthy man,
jolly, but quick-tempered. Mr. Hampshire and he
were on excellent terms. &ldquo;How are you, Markham?
and what&#8217;s your wife baking to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife baking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I concluded you were going to have something
extra spicy. Five pounds of cinnamon look
rather suspicious. Miss Janet&#8217;s not going to step off&mdash;is
she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not in that young person&#8217;s confidence. I
should say not, however. But what do you mean by
your five pounds of cinnamon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Gildersleeve&#8217;s little girl was in here
this morning, and said Mrs. Markham sent for five
pounds of cinnamon and two of raisins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Gildersleeve&#8217;s girl? I know Mrs. Markham
never sent for no such things. She knew I was
coming down myself this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed Mr. Hampshire down the store to the
desk. There it was in the day-book:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td colspan="4" style="text-indent: 2em;">&ldquo;Reub Markham, Dr., per Roxy Gildersleeve.</td></tr>

<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><samp class="pgmark">060</samp>

<p>That Mr. Reub Markham swore, must also be set
down against him. He drove home in a red rage.
Through the open school-house door, little Roxy
Gildersleeve saw him pass; but her merry young heart
boded no ill. Her mouth was tingling pungently with
the fine cinnamon, and in her pocket yet were eight
moist, fat, sugary raisins, to be slipped in her mouth
one by one, four during the geography lesson, four
during the spelling lesson.</p>

<p>As it happened, Mr. Gildersleeve was cultivating
corn in a field that fronted the highway. He and his
wealthier neighbor were not on the best of terms. A
line fence and an unruly ox had made trouble. Mr.
Gildersleeve had sued Mr. Markham, and beat him;
and Mr. Gildersleeve didn&#8217;t take any pains now to
look up as he saw who was coming.</p>

<p>But Mr. Markham drew up his horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Gildersleeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself, Mr. Markham!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, what you sending your young uns down to
the store after things, and charging them to me for?
Mighty creditable that, Tom Gildersleeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting things and charging them to you!&rdquo; Gildersleeve
stopped his horse. &ldquo;What do you mean,
Markham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You better go down and ask Hampshire. If you
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>061</samp>don&#8217;t, you may get it explained in a way you won&#8217;t
fancy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He whipped up his horses and drove off, leaving
Mr. Gildersleeve standing there, gazing after him
as if he had lost his senses. After a moment he
unhitched his horse from the cultivator, mounted him,
and rode off toward the village.</p>

<p>School was out. Roxy had reached home. She
was setting the table, and whistling like a blackbird.
Things had gone so happily at school! Everything
was so neat, and pleasant, and cosy at home! She
saw her father ride into the yard, and go to the barn.
She whistled on.</p>

<p>She sat in the big rocking-chair, stoning cherries,
and smelling the roses by the window, when he came
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s Roxy?&rdquo; she heard him ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the other room, I guess,&rdquo; said mother.</p>

<p>He came in where she was. She looked up; and
her little stained hands fell back into the pan. She
knew the day of judgment had come. O, she wished
it was that other day, the day of death, instead! Her
mouth dropped open, the room turned dark.</p>

<p>Mr. Gildersleeve sank down on a chair. His
child&#8217;s face was too much for him. He groaned
aloud. &ldquo;That one of <i>my</i> children should ever be
<a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>062</samp>talked about as a thief! What possessed you,
Roxy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roxy sat before him, trembling. Not at the prospect
of punishment. But she saw her father&#8217;s eyes
filling up with tears. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t, father,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly,
trying not to cry. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve only eaten a little,
and I will carry it all back. If you will pay for what
is gone, I&#8217;ll sell berries or something, and pay you
back the money. Mr. Hampshire is a good man; he
won&#8217;t tell, father, if you ask him not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor, ignorant child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up and went out, shutting the door after
him. Not one word of punishment; but he left Roxy
trembling with a strange terror. She shook with a
presentiment of some unendurable public disgrace.
Setting down the pan of cherries, she crept to the
door. She heard her father&#8217;s voice, her mother&#8217;s
sharp exclamations. Then her father said, &ldquo;To
think <i>our</i> girl should sin in such a high-handed way!
Mother, I&#8217;d rather laid her in her grave any day!
That hot-headed Markham will not rest until he&#8217;s published
it from Dan to Beersheba. She&#8217;s only a child,
but this thing will stick to her as long as she lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother sobbed. &ldquo;Our poor Roxy! Tom, if the
school children get hold of it, she will never go
another day. The child is so sensitive! I don&#8217;t know
<a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>063</samp>how to punish her as I ought. I can only think how
to save her from what is before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O, how Roxy, standing at the key-hole, trembled to
see her mother lean her head on her father&#8217;s shoulder
and sob, and to see tears on her father&#8217;s cheeks!
O, what a wicked, wicked girl! It <i>was</i> thieving; in
some way it was even worse than that; as if she had
committed a&mdash;a forgery, maybe, Roxy thought. She
was conscious she had done something unusually
daring and dreadful.</p>

<p>She stole off up stairs, shut herself in, and cried
as hard as she could cry. Afterward her little brain
began to busy itself in many directions. She tried to
fancy herself shamed and pointed at, afraid to go to
school, afraid to go down to the store, ashamed to go
to the table, with no right to laugh, and play, and stay
around near her mother, never again to dare ask her
father to ride when he was going off with the horses.</p>

<p>So lonely and gloomy, she tried to think what it
was possible to do. At last, as in the morning, a daring
thought occurred to her suddenly. She made up her
mind in just one minute to do it.</p>

<p>When her mother called, she went down to supper
at once. The boys were gone. Nobody but she and
father and mother; and the three had very red eyes,
and said nothing, but passed things to each other
<a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>064</samp>in a kind, quiet way, that seemed to Roxy like folks
after a funeral&mdash;perhaps it did to the rest of them.
Roxy was fanciful enough to think to herself, &ldquo;Yes,
it is <i>my</i> funeral. We have just buried my good
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silently, one with a white face, the other with a
red one, Roxy and her mother did up the work.
Then Roxy went up to her room again. She took a
sheet of foolscap, and made it into four sheets of note
paper. She wrote and printed something on each
sheet, and folded all the sheets into letters. Then
she went down stairs. Two of the little letters she
handed to her mother. Then, bonnet in hand, she
stole out the front door. At the gate she looked
down the road toward the village, up the road toward
Mr. Markham&#8217;s. She started toward Mr. Markham&#8217;s.
She got over the road marvelously; for the child was
wild to get the thing over with. She was going up
the path to the house when she saw Mr. Markham
hoeing in the garden. She went to him, thrust a note
into his hand, and was off like a dart.</p>

<p>It was a long, hard, lonely run down to the village.
How lonely in the grove at the hollow tree! How like
a thief, with the bundles openly on her arm! No
little girl&#8217;s pocket would hold them, nothing but a
great Judas-bag. She went straight to the stone store.
<a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>065</samp>It was just sunset. How thankful she was to find
nobody in the store but Mr. Hampshire himself, reading
the evening paper. He looked up, and recognized
the red little face. He glanced at the bundles as she
threw them, with a letter, down on the counter, and
whisked out through the door. He called after her,
&ldquo;Here, here, Roxy; here, my dear! Come back.
I have some figs for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no Roxy came back. He heard her little heels
clattering down the sidewalk fast as they could go.
So he got up and read the letter, for it was directed
to himself.</p>

<p>Here are the four notes Roxy wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Father: I Will paye you every Cent if I
Live. I shall always be a Good Girl, and never hanker
after Only what I have Got. Please forgive Me, and
Not Talk It Over with Mother. It will make her
Sick.

<span class="roxy">Roxy.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mother: Please love me until I am Bad
once More. If I ever, Ever, should be Bad again,
then you may give me Up. Don&#8217;t get Sick. <span class="roxy">Roxy.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. MarkHam: I have been Very Wicked. I
have made father and Mother wretched. I am sorry.
<a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>066</samp>Please don&#8217;t be Hard on Me, and Set every body
against me, because My Mother would settle right
down and be very Sick. I am only a Little girl, and
a Big Man might let me go. I have taken the Things
back to the Store. Also father has Paid for them.
<i>You</i> may Want something some day, and do Wrong
to get it, and Then you will know How good it is.

<span class="roxy">R.&nbsp;Gildersleeve.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. HamPshire: Please Not tell the folks that
come into the Store what I did. I want a Chance to
be good. If you Ever hear of my stealing again,
Then you can tell, of course. <span class="roxy">R.&nbsp;Gildersleeve.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="clear: both;">And here is what they said:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Gildersleeve</i> (crying). &ldquo;Here, mother, put this
away. Never speak of it to her. Poor child, I <i>did</i>
mean to whip her!&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gildersleeve</i> (crying). &ldquo;Bless her heart, Tom,
this is true repentance! Our child will not soon forget
this lesson. Let us be very good to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Markham</i> (laughing). &ldquo;Young saucebox!
But there&#8217;s true grit for you! Well, I don&#8217;t think I
shall stoop to injure a child. Let it go. I&#8217;m quits
with Tom now, and we&#8217;ll begin again even.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hampshire</i> (laughing). &ldquo;She&#8217;s a nice little
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><samp class="pgmark"
>067</samp>dot, after all. I don&#8217;t see what possessed her. I&#8217;d
like to show this to Maria; guess I won&#8217;t, though,
for it is partly <i>my</i> business to keep the little name
white.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">
And none of them ever told. When Roxy was an
old woman, she related to me the story herself. The
name was kept white through life. Such a scrupulous,
kindly, charitable old lady! The only strange
thing about her was, that she never could eat anything
flavored with cinnamon, or which had raisins
in it.</p>
